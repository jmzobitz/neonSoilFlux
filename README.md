# neonSoilFlux
neonSoilFlux is a repository code to acquire, tidy, and compute soil respiration fluxes at NEON sites using the flux-gradient method. 

An online applet for visualization at select NEON sites is found [here](https://jmzobitz.shinyapps.io/NEON-soil-fluxes/)

## Installation 
Installation in R through:

- CRAN: `install.packages(neonSoilFlux)`
- Github using the devtools package:

`devtools::install_github("jmzobitz/neonSoilFlux", build = TRUE, build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual"),force=TRUE)`

If you encounter problems with code in this repository, feel free to post an [issue](https://github.com/jmzobitz/neonSoilFlux/issues).

## Usage
To analyze fluxes once the package is installed requires a two step process:

1. Load up the tidyverse and lubridate libraries (`library(tidyverse)` and `library(lubridate)`.  We are heavily making use of `dplyr` and `purrr`, so this should get you covered.

2. First acquire the NEON data, following conventions of `loadByProduct` function in the `neonUtilities` package.
` out_env_data <- acquire_neon_data(site_name = 'SJER',
                  download_date = '2021-06',
                  ) `

3. Then process and compute fluxes.
` out_fluxes <- compute_neon_flux(input_site_env = out_env_data$site_data,
                  input_site_megapit = out_env_data$site_megapit
                  ) `


You now have a data frame of computed fluxes.

More detailed usage information is given in the vignette `using-neonSoilFlux` (`vignette(using-neonSoilFlux)`).
