# neonSoilFlux 3.0.0

* 11.30.2025 Updates to coincide with the release of `neonSoilFlux`: An R Package for Continuous Sensor-Based Estimation of Soil CO~2~ Fluxes, to be published in *Methods in Ecology and Evolution*. We addressed noted issues tracked on the `neonSoilFlux` github page. 


# neonSoilFlux 2.0.0

* 08.23.2025 Updates to package to improve internal efficiency and standardized naming of output fluxes based on the soil levels where the flux is computed.

# neonSoilFlux v1.1.0

* Includes new parameter in `compute_monthly_mean` to allow for flexible time horizons when averaging (e.g. pressure averages over 10 days now).
* Fixed error with `check_qf_flags` to correctly report when QF flag was 2.
* Allows for multiple flux layers to work (`compute_surface_flux_layer`, `compute_flux_gradient_layer` and associated files)

# neonSoilFlux 1.0.0

* 05.21.2024 Package name changed to neonSoilFlux from NEONSoils
* Initial CRAN submission. Submitted 05.2024
