  abstract = {This paper describes a new method to monitor continuously soil CO2 profiles using small solid-state CO2 sensors buried at different depths of the soil. Based on the measurement of soil CO2 profile and a gaseous diffusivity model, we estimated soil CO2 efflux, which was mainly from heterotrophic respiration, and its temporal variation in a dry season in a Mediterranean savanna ecosystem in California. The daily mean values of CO2 concentrations in soils had small variation, but the diurnal variation was significant and correlated well with soil temperature. The daily mean CO2 concentration remained steady at 396{$\mu$}molmol-1 at 2cm depth during the dry summer from days 200 to 235 in 2002. Over the same period, CO2 concentration decreased from 721 to 611{$\mu$}molmol-1 at 8cm depth, and from 1044 to 871{$\mu$}molmol-1 at 16cm. The vertical soil CO2 concentrations changed almost linearly with depth up to 16cm, but the gradient varied over time. Based on the soil CO2 gradient and the diffusion coefficient estimated from the Millington--Quirk model, continuous soil CO2 efflux was calculated. The daily mean values of CO2 efflux slightly decreased from 0.43 to 0.33{$\mu$}molm-2s-1 with a mean of 0.37{$\mu$}molm-2s-1. The mean diurnal range of CO2 efflux was greater than the range of daily mean CO2 efflux within the study period. The diurnal variation of soil CO2 efflux ranged from 0.32 to 0.45{$\mu$}molm-2s-1 with the peak value reached between 14:30 and 16:30h. This pattern corresponded well with the increase in soil temperatures during this time. By plotting CO2 efflux vs. soil temperature, we found that CO2 efflux correlated exponentially with soil temperature at the depth of 8cm, with R2 of 0.86 and Q10 of 1.27 in the summer dry season. The Q10 value increased with the depth of soil temperature measurements. The high correlation between CO2 efflux and temperature explains the diurnal pattern of CO2 efflux, but moisture may become another factor driving the seasonal pattern when moisture changes over seasons. The estimated CO2 efflux using this method was very close to chamber measurements, suggesting that this method can be used for long-term continuous measurements of soil CO2 efflux.},

  abstract = {Continuous measurements of soil respiration and its components help us understand diurnal and seasonal variations in soil respiration and its mechanism. We continuously measured CO2 concentration at various depths in the soil and calculated surface CO2 efflux based on CO2 gradients and diffusivity in a young ponderosa pine plantation in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. We determined soil respiration both in a control plot that included roots and in a trenched plot that had no roots. The difference between these plots was used to partition soil respiration into root respiration and heterotrophic respiration. We found that both CO2 concentration in the soil and surface CO2 efflux in the control plot were higher than in the trenched plot. The diurnal range of soil respiration in the trenched plot was larger than in the control. We observed dramatic pulses of soil respiration in response to rain events in summer and fall during the dry season. We modeled the seasonal variation in soil respiration without the pulses using soil temperature and moisture as driving variables and simulated soil respiration pulses using an exponential decay function in response to the volume of rain. Daily mean soil respiration peaked at 5.0{$\mu$}molm-2s-1 in the control and at 2.7{$\mu$}molm-2s-1 in the trenched plot in June before the rain pulses. Soil respiration increased from 4.9 to 8.2 and to 12.1{$\mu$}molm-2s-1 after the first and second rain events in the control, and increased from 2.2 to 4.1 and to 6.6{$\mu$}molm-2s-1 in the trenched plot. After incorporating the pulse effect, the model simulated measured data well. Annual soil respiration in 2003 was estimated as 1184gCm-2y-1. The average ratio of root over total respiration was 0.56 during the growing season and 0.16 during the non-growing season with an annual average of 0.44.},

  abstract = {We conducted a field experiment in a cool-temperate deciduous forest to investigate the dynamic behavior of soil CO2 and the vertical distribution of soil respiration. Soil CO2 concentration (C) was measured half-hourly at four depths for 6 months in 2000 with infrared gas analyzers installed below ground. Using C profiles, soil surface CO2 efflux (F0), CO2 production rates of the topsoil (PA), and CO2 flux from the subsoil to topsoil (FCA) were evaluated half-hourly by applying Fick's first law. Some remarkable short-term and long-term variations were found in C, F0, PA, FCA, and the contribution of topsoil respiration to total soil respiration (PA/F0), which include (1) rapid increase in C and decrease in F0 and PA due to rainwater infiltration, (2) diurnal variation in C coupled with that of the atmosphere, (3) diurnal variation in F0 and PA similar to that of topsoil temperature, (4) decrease in C, F0, and PA following soil drying in August, (5) linearly increasing FCA between late May and mid-September, and (6) decrease in PA/F0 from around 0.9 during summer to 0.3 in November. The variation of PA was mainly controlled by soil temperature at -0.07 m between 7{$^\circ$} and 17{$^\circ$}C, although PA did not respond well to soil temperature above and below this temperature range. Above 17{$^\circ$}C, PA increased linearly with soil moisture, and moisture variation accounted for the PA decrease in August. Neither temperature nor moisture explained the PA behavior below 7{$^\circ$}C. Subsoil respiration (FCA) showed an exponential relationship with soil temperature at -1 m.},
