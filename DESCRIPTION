Description: Acquires and synthesizes soil carbon fluxes at sites located in the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). Provides flux estimates and associated uncertainty as well as key environmental measurements (soil water, temperature, CO2  concentration) that are used to compute soil fluxes.
